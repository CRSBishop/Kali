Load Balancer - A load balancer acts as a proxy to balance traffic between servers in order to reduce workload for servers or prevent crashing. Most Load balancers are stateful
				Used to maintain state - stateless or stateful
				When a connection is maintaining state - some communications need to retain information in able to make inteligent decisions for how to respond or process a specific request.
				If a device can do this, this is a stateful device
				If a device only receives a request and passes it on, no packet inspection or data retention or packet inspection (assembling packets etc), this device is stateless
