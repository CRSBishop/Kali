Load Balancer - A load balancer acts as a proxy to balance traffic between servers in order to reduce workload for servers or prevent crashing. Most Load balancers are stateful
				Used to maintain state - stateless or stateful
				When a connection is maintaining state - some communications need to retain information in able to make inteligent decisions for how to respond or process a specific request.
				If a device can do this, this is a stateful device
				If a device only receives a request and passes it on, no packet inspection or data retention or packet inspection (assembling packets etc), this device is stateless
				
Tool so scan for load banacers - lbd (Load balancer Detector)

Firewall - Firewalls are used to minitor and control traffic on a network

Web application firewall (WAF) - a dedicated firewall, which guards against common attacks such as XSS and SQLi attacks

TCP Flags - geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-flags/
Synchronization (SYN)
Acknowledgement (ACK)
Finish (FIN)
Reset (RST)
Urgent (URG)
Push (PSH)
Window (WND)
Checksum (CHK)
Sequence Number (SEQ)

Firewalking - Firewalking is another method to discover details of the network
Firewalking uses a combination of traceroute and port scanning to discover the details of the internal network

To streamline the workflow the team can use automated tools
in addition to custom nmap scriots, there are several automated tools for WAF detection available on github such as Wafw00f and WAFNinja


In general there are a few methods to avoid anti virus detection

1. create a metamorphic virus, which transforms as they propagate and makes pattern detection nearly impossible
2. Obfuscate a known signature using a tool such as ObfuscatedEmpire
3. use specalised tools or paylods such as fileless malware that use OS embedded functions that are difficult to detect
